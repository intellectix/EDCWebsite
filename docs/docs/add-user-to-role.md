## PRO

To add a user to a role, first click on the "Roles" link on the left side of the page.  

Once on the Roles page, select the Role to add users to. This EDC will redirect to that Role's Edit page.  

Now click on the "Members" tab. This tab will show a list of all the users currently assigned to this role. To add a User, click the "Add Member" button. The EDC will load a new page where you can select the user to add from the dropdown. Once a user has been selected, click "Add Member."  

If the EDC successfully adds the user to the role, the EDC will redirect back to the Role's Edit page and the user will be listed under the Members tab. This user will now have access to all the database permissions defined under this Role.

## Remove a User From a Role

To remove a User from a Role, go to the "Members" tab and the click on the X under the Action column. This will delete the User from the Role and will refresh the page.
