## Create User

When you are logged into the EDC Dashboard, click the "Users" link on the left of the page.  

Once on the Users page, click the "Add User" button in the top right corner.  

Next, you must provide a unique username and an Active/Inactive status for the user. Then click "Create User."

If the EDC successfully creates the user, the system will return you to the Users page and you should see your new user displayed in the list. You can now add this user to a role to provide the user with permissions.

## Editing a User  

To edit a User, click on the username of the user you wish to edit.

This will take you to a page which will allow you to update any of the information you provided when you added the user.
