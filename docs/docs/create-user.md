## Create User

Once logged into the EDC Dashboard, click the "Users" link on the left of the page.  

Once on the Users page, click the "Add User" button in the top right corner.  

Next, provide a unique username and an Active/Inactive status for the user. Then click "Create User."

If the EDC successfully creates the user, the system will redirect to the Users page and the new user will be displayed in the list. This user can now be added to a role to provide the user with permissions.

## Editing a User  

To edit a User, click on the username of the user to edit.

This will generate a page which will allows updates to any of the information provided when the user was added.
