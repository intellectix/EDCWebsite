## Create Role

When you are logged into the EDC Dashboard, click the "Roles" link on the left of the page.  

Once on the Roles page, click the "Add Role" button in the top right corner.  

Next, you must provide a unique Name, a Description, and an Active/Inactive status for the role. Then click "Next."

If the EDC successfully creates the role, the system will return you to the Role's Edit page. You can now add users and permissions to this role.  

## Editing a Role  

To edit a Role, click on the username of the role you wish to edit.

This will take you to the Role's Edit page. The first tab will show you the basic information about the role that you provided when you created the role. The next tab will allow you to add different database permissions to that role. Finally, the last tab will allow you to add users to the role so that your system users can begin querying data.
