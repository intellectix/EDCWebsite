On the top of the dashboard, you can see the number of database requests you have received today, the number of unique IP Addresses that have requested data, and the number of failed requests.  

Beneath the scoreboard, you will see two graphs. On the left, you have a pie chart which shows a quick breakdown of the day's requests. You can over over the pie chart to see how many GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests you have received today. On the right, you have a bar graph which shows you a breakdown of the past week and the number of requests received each day.  

Underneath the graphs, you will see the 10 most recent requests. You can click on the requests to see more in-depth information. You can also hit the refresh button to check for any new requests.
